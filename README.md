# MANET-in-OMNetpp
Implemented MANET protocol with help of AODV routing in OMNet++

### Motivation
I did this a long time ago when I was a student, it was actually one of the most difficult and unique projects in the "wireless networks" course.

#### Document
I wrote a full document of what I'd done but it's not EN so maybe I add a EN document later.
